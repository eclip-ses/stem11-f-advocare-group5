                    <h3>Overview of AI in the Workforce</h3>
                    <p>AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in Filipino workplaces. A recent study reports that 86% of Filipino knowledge workers already use AI tools, indicating rapid adoption nationwide. Although over 90% of Philippine businesses have computers and internet access, only around 15% currently utilize AI, revealing a significant gap between digital access and actual AI adoption.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Companies face challenges such as limited skills, insufficient funding, and lack of awareness about AI tools. Globally, AI growth is accelerating due to affordable computing power and automation demand. The Philippines is following this trend as industries like BPO and ICT digitalize to stay competitive.</p>

                    <h3>How AI Transforms Employment</h3>
                    <p>AI is rapidly changing the nature of work in the Philippines. The World Bank estimates that 35–37% of Filipino jobs are exposed to AI-related risks. However, an IMF analysis shows that about 61% of highly exposed roles are "highly complementary," meaning AI is more likely to support workers rather than fully replace them.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The BPO sector, which contributes over 7% of the country's GDP, faces the greatest disruption due to reliance on routine tasks. Yet AI also creates opportunities: it can save workers hours of manual work weekly and increase productivity and wages. New roles like AI trainers, data analysts, and automation specialists continue to emerge.</p>

                    <h3>Core Problems Identified</h3>
                    <p><strong>Skills Mismatch:</strong> Although 86% of knowledge workers use AI tools, many companies haven't provided guided training, leaving workers unprepared. Others lack digital skills entirely and face barriers like inadequate internet connectivity and limited funds.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> Organizations using AI for hiring, workflow supervision, and decision-making raise ethical questions. Dependence on "Bring Your Own AI" practices increases the probability of data and algorithmic discrimination, particularly since most organizations lack policies on responsible AI use.</p>

                    <h3>Why This Social Issue Matters</h3>
                    <p>Changes in employment due to AI present risks to the income stability of numerous Filipino households. The 18-24 age group, where generative AI utilization stands at 64%, faces particular disruption risks while simultaneously engaging with this technology.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">According to the World Bank, an estimated 35-37% of jobs at risk from AI are held by the nation's educated youth. To address economic challenges from an unprepared workforce, AI should be employed to promote sustainable economic productivity while upholding the dignity of work.</p>

Jobs such as AI trainers, data analysts, and automation specialists continue to grow as companies increasingly rely on digital tools. These roles demonstrate that AI is not only automating tasks but also creating new opportunities for those who upskill.</p>

                    <h3>Impact of AI on Young Filipino Workers</h3>
                    <p>AI is making a huge impact on how young Filipinos work. In fact, 64% of Filipino employees aged 18-24 report using generative AI. While this provides opportunities for greater productivity, it also means these young workers are more exposed to potential future job disruptions. Between 35-37% of Philippine jobs are considered at risk, putting many young Filipino workers in vulnerable positions.</p>

                    <h3>Human Strengths That AI Cannot Replace</h3>
                    <p>Even with AI becoming more common in Filipino workplaces, people beat AI with irreplaceable qualities: empathy, teamwork, and creativity. These drive new ideas and make humans work well together—something AI cannot replicate. Even though almost half of Filipinos (46%) already use AI at work, it's still humans who make big decisions and lead to success.</p>

                    <h3>The Ethical Challenges of AI in the Workplace</h3>
                    <p>One major ethical challenge is protecting workers whose jobs are at risk due to AI—35-37% of jobs are affected, creating tension between innovation and job security. There's also the fairness challenge: not all Filipino workers have equal access to upskilling, with almost half citing poor internet access and lack of time to learn AI-related skills. Companies must ensure AI is used responsibly and transparently so workers understand how career-affecting decisions are made.</p>

                <p><strong>Gifts:</strong> Curiosity, problem-solving, creativity <br>
                My gifts include curiosity, problem-solving, and creativity. My curiosity drives me to explore how things work and gain a deeper understanding of various topics. My problem-solving skills enable me to analyze challenges and find effective solutions. My creativity enables me to design innovative ideas, enhance existing concepts, and present new ideas in engaging ways.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Connection to Issue:</strong> My curiosity pushes me to learn how AI is transforming jobs and skills in the Philippines. This helps me gather accurate information and understand the issue from different perspectives. My problem-solving skills enable me to break down complex problems, such as AI risks or ethical issues, and explain them clearly to others. My creativity supports our advocacy by helping me create visuals or website layouts that make the topic more interesting for our audience. These gifts enable me to demonstrate that AI should be used responsibly and that humans must develop skills that complement, rather than compete with, technology.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Role in Advocacy:</strong> With these gifts, I see myself as a designer and researcher. I can help organize information, analyze sources, and distill complex ideas into clear and concise content. I can also contribute to the layout and visual design of the website, making our advocacy easy to understand and appealing to viewers.</p>

                <p><strong>Gifts:</strong> Technology, Creative Designing, Desire to gain Knowledge <br>
                My gifts include creative designing, a considerable interest in technology, and a desire to gain more knowledge. These gifts that I’ve received can be utilized to easily understand our Advo-Care topic, specifically the debate between AI and humans in the workforce.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Connection to Issue:</strong> My gifts to the issues because I am constantly updated on all the recent news, all about AI, which can be used to assist my groupmates in gathering information that includes AI. My desire to gain more knowledge also helps me in my pursuit of information about AI, where I can’t stop until I’ve gained all the necessary pieces of knowledge. I am also a creative designer, and as such, I have firsthand experience witnessing how AI is replacing people in this field of work. As a result, I know what it feels like, and my perspective can help shed more light on the issue.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Role in Advocacy:</strong> Using my gifts, I envision myself as a provider of information/researcher, a web designer, a coder, and, at times, as a victim myself of this. My interest in technology helps me gather accurate information about AI, while my creative skills allow me to design the visuals for our website. Since I’ve seen how AI affects creative jobs, I can also share insights that will help our group show why responsible and ethical AI use matters.</p>

                <h4>Key Message</h4>
                <p>AI is not a new species, but rather a tool to provide additional assistance. AI can never replace the compassion and commitment of a human being. Humans and AI should coexist as a force for change and innovation, rather than one becoming extinct. When we work together, we can achieve more with AI's knowledge combined with our human values and physical actions.</p>
